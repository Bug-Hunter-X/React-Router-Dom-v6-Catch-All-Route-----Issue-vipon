# React Router Dom v6 Catch All Route '*' Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route ('*') in React Router Dom v6.  The problem is that the catch-all route doesn't function as expected, preventing a 404-like Not Found component from rendering for invalid routes.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Navigate to an invalid route to observe the issue.  The solution provides a corrected implementation.
